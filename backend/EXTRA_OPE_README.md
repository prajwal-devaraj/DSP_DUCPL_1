# Extra Credit – Order Preserving Encryption (OPE)
Weight is plaintext to enable range queries now (meets base reqs). To attempt extra credit, add OPE:
- Store `weight_ope` encoded by your OPE scheme at insert time.
- Replace `/query` to filter on `weight_ope`.
- Document design & security notes here and in your extra report.
